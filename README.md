## how it works

- start focus sessions with a set duration
- during the session, you will not be able to visit any of the blocked websites configured (by you!)
- you will NOT be able to prematurely terminate the session
- which means, you will finally get some work done instead of watching youtube.

in conclusion, get-a-life aims to be the father you never had.
